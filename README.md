# healthhack2015_genome_browser

##About
FileUM (the application) is a front end interface for automating the upload of genome file types for visualisation in a [Genome Browser](http://gb.pearg.com).

This will be of benefit to genetics researchers (without any bioinfomatics skill set) to contribute data and knowledge to a common database. Thereby, increasing accessibility to the wider scientific community and further research efforts in these domains. 
This project was created as part of [Healthhack 2015 Melbourne] (http://healthhack.com.au)
